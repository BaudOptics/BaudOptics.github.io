  <p>Hi I'm a sax player and video game designer,
    <br>
     I'm currently studying data science at Rice University</p>

  style = "width:400px">

  <p>I started playing sax in 6th grade, went to HSPVA<br>
     and then UH Moore's School of Music. A few years later<br>
    I went to HCC for a video game design degree with a<br>
    Programming focus. I am now studying at Rice to learn<br>
    about coding for data science.</p>

  <p>I am currently playing saxophone professionally<br>
    in the city of Houston, TX at various venues around<br>
    town and enjoying learning new skills to prepare me<br>
    for the future.</p>
